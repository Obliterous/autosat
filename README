README for autoatp v0.1

A script to automate ATP reception and decoding with RTLSDR dongles and linux.
---------------------------------
quickstart: 
make sure that you have the following tools installed: rtl_fm, atpdec (in the same folder as this script), timeout, at, sox, predict

make certain that your /home/$username/.predict/predict.tle file has entries for NOAA-15 NOAA-18 NOAA-19 (I'll paste the tle's at the bottom of this file)

run predict and make certain that you location is correct, exit predict (if your location isn't correct, you'll never receive anything!)

edit the script so that outpath points to wherever you want your audio and image files to be stored, and save.

execute the script:

./autoatp NOAA-15
./autoatp NOAA-18
./autoatp NOAA-19

wait for images to apear in the output directory!
---------------------------------

I created this tool because of frustration with the non-free windows app wxtoimg and all of the challenges involved in getting it to work with linux and RTLSDRs

Thanks to my dear friend Jessica Litwin, for writing the bits that I couldn't and correcting me when I stuck my head in a dark and smelly place. This wouldn't exist at all without her.

Thanks to John, KD2BD for creating predict,
